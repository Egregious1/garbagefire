                    Alright bois the time has come for me to pivot again so my adhd riddled brain and start a fucking python project :D. This one is good though its a simple text adventure that is already proving itself to be a pain in the sack for my stupid mind. I got as far as the intro with a little title screen and some imputs functions and all this supers simple shit that a blind toddler could probably program but you know what its my piece of garbage.

                    This gives me a perfect chance to add my github account to this stupid blog to nowhere in the contact or about me section or hell just at the footer...will have to figure that out for the time being this is the repo that I have this thing at <a href="https://github.com/Egregious1/pytextgame">Right here</a>
                    <br>
                    God damnit now I have to write some css to deal with the ugly as fuck hyperlink. guess now is as good a time as any right. I am thinking I'll probably have to add the same lines of code to all the stylesheets but I will do that as needed as for now this is the only hyperlink that I have on this piss bucket of a page so I'll just start here.

                    Ominous title huh? Well it how I always feel right so whats new? <br>
                    Anywho, I have been going back and forth between python and this and I think I should just focus on learning front end web dev. I do have the most knowledge on it right now and I can get to a working level of understanding the quickes right? 
                    <br>
                    I mean the who point was to give myself a better skill set to make some of that remote income. What ever the fuck that means.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    back to why I am here. I need to find a better background for the site. I think its time to start looking at other blogs and see how shitty my work really is...so here we gooooooo:
                    <br>
                    Okay so seeing a couple much better blogs I see that I could use simple things like an <code><hr></code> tag to make things a little less cluttered i think...i mean I like the way it looks for sure and I figured out a way to make it look less shitty but dont you worry it still looks like shit.
                    <br>
                    Alright added the hr tag to everything that needed it and fixed the little no repeat issue with the background img (Which i want to change anyway but its good to know how to fix it obviously.) also added a footer to everything which is a small but nice change.
                    <br>
                    Now I just need to get some inspo on where to go from here. Maybe its a good time to start a seperate project that I can post here and have some finished products that can at least make me feel good. hell I might be able to learn more JS (but I am an idiot so thats probably a no...) who know what will happen?!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Okay I did it again. Now I am here learning to make a text based game in python and really I am okay with that. Learning py will give me another set of skills that will be good for web development. its a good thing.
                    <br>
                    On a lighter note I almost whooped my roommate today after he decided to call his daddy on me. What a fucking cuck.

                    Its been over 9 months since I have last opened up VSC and it makes me sad every time this happens.
                    It shows that although I have the desire to make things and really learn something new I am
                    constantly letting my projects fall by the way side. Very similar to the art projects I keep putting
                    off. Its as if I have an issue with finishing things. Come to think of it I had the same kind of
                    bullshit response to finishing books I enjoyed reading...weird.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I am still working so things are still going okay in that regard. I may be getting myself in to more
                    debt than I would like but hey thats what happens when you have little to no self control amirite?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Anywho, last night the roommate (I have moved so this is a second roommate who has proven to be more
                    of a problem) apparently started barring his door with chains on the inside out of fear that Crvnch
                    and I would break in. Fucking crazy huh? Well now I dont feel comfortable with that mf being
                    anywhere around my shit or my kitten (got a new kitty Batou the vato gato hes adorable and will take
                    over the world) so now I am stressed and decided if I am going to sit here and wait for him to come
                    in with my firearm ready to deal with him then I should at least go back and try to learn something
                    that I have been trying to do forever. Okay cool.
                    <!-- i think its time i start explain what things I am trying to do and how i am going about them here -->
                    <br>
                    So I havent looked at this site in a while and I need to figure out what parts are shit (all of it)
                    and what are okay (none of it)
                    <br>
                    hey cool I got some links and multiple pages together which I think is nice. It looks like a dogshit
                    stuffed with baby barf but we will get to that eventually. <br>
                    I did notice that my about my section is actually missing the nav bar that I have set up in the home
                    page and the blog page so first things first lets get that copied over and make sure it works...
                    <br>
                    ALRIGHT its in and it works. Now I see that I have a link for a contact page...with no contact
                    page...(whos got two thumbs and fucking retard? this guy.) so I am going to make a simple one and
                    link the home.css styles to it to make things easier and faster...i hope. it should work since I am
                    already utilizing it on another html<br>
                    <br>
                    i think it turned out great. I managed to take some code from W3 on sticky nav bars and worked it
                    into my existing code for the blog only at this point. as I am writing this I feel like it would be
                    kind of pointless to not add the css to all the the style sheets I am using on this craptacular site
                    I am building for the last 3 years...what am I doing with my life?
                    <br>
                    no time for that only time for coding! or what ever this is...
                    <br>
                    okay its done and I think it looks a little better. Now i should do something about that horrible
                    background...
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Back to my shit head tweaker roommate who I used to call a friend. well hes not a friend anymore and
                    needs to be kicked out. How we are going to do that is something I will need to see when it happens.
                    He is a pos of the highest order and not worth anymore of my time.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    on a lighter note I realized that I didnt forget absolutely everything when it came to using git!
                    hurray me!

                    <br>
                    actually...i fucked it up.
                    <br>
                    as usually since I dont have anyone to hold my hand I didnt realize that I was looking at an example of what a repo url should look like and since I dont spend enough time on github I ended up sending all the code to my about me in github...but not to worry its not like any of this shit is going to be in the final product so i guess everything is basically okay right? RIGHT?! 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    pretty sure everything is fine...

                    I'm back...still with this long term project to learn how to fight for myself in a finacial sense. I
                    should be asking myself these questions:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Do I want to actually do this?</li>
                    <li>Why am I wasting so much time?</li>
                    <li>What do I need to make these things a reality?</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <br>
                I have some answers for the first two. That last questiong is a bit more of a mystery to me. I can think
                of at least one major roadblock that I keep putting infront of me. A big issue of mine that is a bit
                harder to overcome is my lack of attention. I cant seem to keep my head on task for longer than five
                minutes when it comes to my own projects. When at work or doing other things I can stay in the mindset
                for a little while longer. This is something that I need to overcome some how. If I need to treat my ADD
                in a more traditional way than so be it. I want to be able to stay on target. I need to. My room needs
                cleaning in other ways as well and I will come to that when it happens. As for now I will do my best to
                actually get this thing up and running.
                <br>
                <br>
                Any who I have been thinking about how to make a better layout for this site and came across using imgs
                that I create in gimp or ps. This would make the process of planning out simple web designs a litte
                easier and I will just need to either create or find the right imgs to use in the production of these
                ideas. At the moment I dont understand js enought to be able to create these things on the fly and my
                css knowlede leaves a lot to be desired the source code for the styles on these pages is proof enough. I
                can't get better unless I keep working at it right?
                <br>
                I also have a habit of starting these new found second winds at the worst possible time. I find myself
                hating my choices in the moment when I can do nothing productive about them to begin with. I need to
                immerse myself in these things again. really grit my teeth and start absording everything I can
                concerning this.
                <br>
                I miss linux. It was so much simpler for me. I might just have to get a seperate machine just to run
                linux. far less distractions and I really dont mind being in front of a terminal all the time in fact I
                kind of enjoy it. gui are nice but nothing really beats the terminal for me. i must be crazy.

                        Another go at this silly project to learn how to develop web sites. It seems like such a silly
                        idea
                        that I have been chasing for the better part of a year now and because I am a very lazy
                        individual I
                        cant seem to keep myself motivated enough to keep the nose to the grinding stone as it were.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The thing is I have this dream of living a life where I can work from anywhere. As of right now
                        I
                        work in retail which means a sedintary life for the most part. It makes having freedom of
                        movement
                        really hard to achieve. Dont get me wrong I love my job, I work in an art store and it feels
                        good
                        getting people in the mindset of an artist if they are new to it and helping seasoned artist to
                        find
                        new paths to the answer they are trying to find. Its just a job though. I dont get paid very
                        well in
                        reality to the amount of time I am putting forth and the skills I am learning are only useful to
                        the
                        company that I am working for. its a bit of a drag to be honest.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Part of me thinks it might because I really dont know what I want to do with this skill set.
                        What am
                        I really trying to accomplish? Do I even want to do this at all?
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I can at least answer that last question. Yes, I do. I have always been interested in the idea
                        of
                        making web sites. Even as a kid with angelfire and geocities and the myriad of other web site
                        creation platforms. I was not even sure what I was really doing but I made new pages time after
                        time. I never had a good idea as to what I was trying to make. Its something that always vexes
                        me
                        when it comes to creation. I dont have the mindset that takes a concept and can flesh it out in
                        a
                        theoritical sense. I get stuck on go and I don't even know where square one is. Its my own fault
                        I
                        let myself feel defeated but no more. I understand that I am my own worse enemy and I need to
                        make
                        changes if I want to have a better life. This might be the start of something good...
